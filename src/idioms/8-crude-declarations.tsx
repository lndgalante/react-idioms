// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Solution ðŸ‘‡

1) Mapping over calendarDays return a span element, which is not a valid child of the ol element, so we need an li element in this case
2) We can move the calendarDays outside the component and use it as a constant, so it is not re-declared on every render

3) Optionally we can use MACRO_CASE for the calendarDays constant to indicate that it is a constant
4) Optionally we can use the as const assertion to indicate that the array is a readonly tuple
5) Also we can rename the val variable to day to make it more descriptive
